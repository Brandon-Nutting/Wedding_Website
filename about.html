        Brandon and Anna first crossed paths in the fall of 2019, during a friend's backyard barbecue in Annapolis.
        What started as a casual chat over grilled corn and craft beer quickly turned into hours of laughter and shared stories.
        They soon discovered a mutual love for sailing, Sunday morning coffee walks, and spontaneous road trips.

        Over the years, they’ve supported each other through new jobs, pandemic lockdowns, and the everyday ups and downs of life.
        Whether it was getting lost in the mountains of Shenandoah or dancing under the stars at a concert, they found joy in every shared moment.

        In the spring of 2024, Brandon proposed during a sunset picnic by the Chesapeake Bay—the very place they first said “I love you.”
        And now, they can’t wait to celebrate their next adventure—marriage—surrounded by friends and family.
